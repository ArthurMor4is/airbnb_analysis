# Airbnb New User Bookings
The present work aims to predict in which country will a new user
make its first booking on the Airbnb platform using the datasets available at
Kaggle’s competition [“Airbnb New User Bookings”](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbnb-recruiting-new-user-bookings/). In this regard, a machine
learning model using the XGBoost algorithm was built aiming to optimize the
Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG).
